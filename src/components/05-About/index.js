          Hi, I'm Heather. I'm on my way to becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer,
          currently enrolled in University of Pennsylvania's Coding Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon I plan to retire from the food industry so I can dive into a full time
          position in tech. In order to be well-rounded in this field, I'm
          interested in a variety of positions, but I can't deny a special
          interest in Front-End configuration. This August I will recieve my
          Full-Stack Web Development Certificate and I am really excited to
          continue learning while actually on the ground. My Coding experience
          is recent, but intensive. I also have a Bachelor's Degree in Art
          History and Criticism from Temple University, where I spent years
          gaining experience constantly adapting to new enviornments with roles
          in a variety of departments and organizations in the art world. More
          recently, I've also been working with small businesses to build their
          brands through various forms of marketing and gaining virtual foot
          traffic by means of website design and e-commerce.
